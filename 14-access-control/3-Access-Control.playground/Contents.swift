/*

 Swift provides five different access levels for entities within your code:

 open - is the least restrictive. Anyone can subclass and override.
 public - Anyone can subclass and override within module
 internal - default, allows access within module
 fileprivate - restricts entity to to its own defining source file (even outside the type)
 private - limits to withing the type

 Typically we use:
 - public / private / internal
 - seldom use open, fileprivate
