/*
 It's a little bit style. More about semantics. ðŸŒˆ

 A property in Swift very much implies some form of access to the current state of a value or object â€” without changing it. So anything that modifies state, for example by returning a new value, is most likely better represented by a method.

*/

// let finishedEpisode = episode.finished() // Looks like we're performing an action to finish the episode
// let finishedEpisode = episode.finished   // Looks like we're accessing some form of "finished" data

// ðŸ¤– So favor properties when accessing data. And reach for the method when changing it.
