/*
ðŸ•¹ Bad Bill - programmer error

 Take the payBill you just created, and re-write it to genereate a programmer error (assert() or preCondition())
 instead of throwing an error.

 Discussion: What are the differences between these two techniques? Which do you prefer? Why?

payBill2(1)
//payBill2(-1)

/*
 Discussion:

 - Advantages of throwing
  - Can signal to client why call failed (more precise error handling).
  - Useful for client input.
  - Use if expected and may need to react

 - Advantages of asserting
  - Good for unexpected programming errors when situation really should not have happened
  - Bug on your part
  - Good to use when developing (can stop and fix bug immediately)
  - Can then decide whether
   - Stop only in degug builds (assertion)
   - Stop in release builds/production (precondition/fatal)
